This directory contains tools to test Markovian's speed.

speedbenchmark.fens contains 500 random fens taken from 711891 games in which at least one player had ELO at least 2400.

speedbenchmark.plies was built by taking the first ply to exceed 5.0 seconds, using the code at commit 274b5c81df54d6512c4ad4e1aa8123b936f89637.
