-1,138,,,"(Roughly; handtimed). This is the Python version."
14,0.643,,,"Added best line structs = more memory overhead"
15,0.754,,,"Removed move_info pointer from move struct, put into move_array. Thus are malloc/writing/freeing more in score(pos,0)"
16,0.243,,,"No more mallocing/writing/freeing in score(pos,0): only count #moves"
17,0.188,,,"Preliminary alpha-beta pruning. (not yet in computer_move)"
18,0.161,,,"Putting alpha-beta into computer_move too"
19,0.263,,,"Debugging memchecks in ai.c, optimized/fixed find_piece, debugged rooksac."
20,0.0149,,,"Fixed alpha-beta: if(high <= low) not if(high < low)"
22,0.0148,,,"Few changes, mostly user based"
27,0.0377,,,"New bitboard structs, writing lots of memory for undoing moves, (no unmove function yet)"
28,0.0133,,,"Analyze captures first"
29,0.0166,,,"Sort moves based upon captured piece value"
30,0.0168,,,"Added en passant"
32,0.0168,,,"Chess implemented almost fully properly: castling + en passant + promotion (real time: 0.0239)"
35,0.23,,,"Implemented quiescience search"
36,0.23,,,"Added TOLERANCE in ai.c comparisons"
37,0.225,,,"Precomputed notlinboard = ~linboard"
37,0.219,,,"Changed ffsll and inlined it"
37,0.214,128.5,,"Don't evaluate full position if down two pawns; much higher expected performance gains for middle game."
38,0.157,2.84,61.6,"Implemented negamax, fixed quiescient search bug. (now evaluates a position before its children)"
40,0.15,3.23,78.3,"Some bug fixes, adding code to see if in check, and beginning iterative deepening"
42,0.091,4.12,,"Beginning iterative deepening, but presumed bugs. Changed evaluation function slightly."
45,0.07,0.84,29.3,"Fixed move-ordering bug, (was doing backwards!), set memory load constant."
49,0.0767,,,"Begun implementing hashes."
51,0.036,0.132,3.02,"Created dequietmoves to only generate captures, pawn promotions, and (later) checks, implemented hashing for quiet(.), changed control_eval to favor control center, fixed serious bug in quiet, (wasn't checking if first eval yielded cutoff)."
52,0.04,0.5,7.1,"Added pawn structure and king safety terms to the evaluation function"
53,0.038,0.42,6.57,"Added best move to cache, in use for quiet"
61,0.016,0.67,11.5,"Plays Na4 on ply 6. evaluation function contains control_eval and pawn_eval"
